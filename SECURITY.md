# Security Policy

This security policy outlines our commitment to addressing security vulnerabilities in the Image Resizer project. We strive to maintain a secure environment for all users.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in Image Resizer, please report it to us immediately.  **Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been addressed.**

You can report vulnerabilities by:

* **Creating a private security issue on GitHub:**  While GitHub doesn't have a *dedicated* private issue type, you can create a new issue and explicitly state in the description that it's a security vulnerability and request confidentiality.  We will then work with you privately to resolve the issue.

* **Contacting the maintainers directly (if a specific contact method is listed in the repository):** Check the repository's README or other documentation for contact information.

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide the following information:

* A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
* The affected version(s) of Image Resizer.
* Any potential impact of the vulnerability.
* Your name/handle (optional, but appreciated).

## Supported Versions

We aim to provide timely security updates for the most recent version of Image Resizer.  Older versions may not receive security updates.  We encourage users to use the latest version to benefit from the most up-to-date security patches.

## Vulnerability Handling Process

We follow a responsible disclosure process for handling security vulnerabilities:

1. **Triage:** We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report and begin investigating it as soon as possible.

2. **Investigation:** We will investigate the vulnerability to understand its scope and impact.

3. **Fix:** We will develop and test a fix for the vulnerability.

4. **Release:** We will release a new version of Image Resizer that includes the fix.

5. **Disclosure:** After the new version is released, we may publicly disclose the vulnerability (if appropriate) to inform the community and prevent further exploitation.  We will coordinate with the reporter before any public disclosure.

## Security Practices

We employ the following security practices in the development of Image Resizer:

* **Dependency Management:** We keep our dependencies up-to-date and regularly review them for known vulnerabilities.
* **Code Review:** We conduct code reviews to identify and address potential security issues.
* **Input Validation:** We validate user input to prevent injection attacks.
* **Secure Coding Practices:** We follow secure coding practices to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities.

## Scope

This security policy applies to the Image Resizer project and its official releases.

## Contact

For security-related inquiries, please create a private security issue on GitHub as described above.

Thank you for helping us keep Image Resizer secure!
